A production-grade platform engineering starter kit for mobile teams that includes:

- 📱 A modular mobile app (Android or iOS)
- ⚙️ CI/CD pipeline with automated builds, tests, and releases
- 🔐 Security features (biometric auth, secure storage)
- 📊 Observability (crash reporting, performance metrics)
- 🧪 Scalable testing setup (unit + UI tests)
- 🤖 AI features (self healing systems, tooling, monitoring)

## Purpose

[Mobile Platform Engineering](https://www.mobilesystemdesign.com/blog/what-is-a-mobile-platform-engineer/) is used in complex enterprise applications with a lot of engineers to streamline modular work, break down silos, and oversee architecture.

Signs platform engineering is required is when features take too long, problems keep repeating among teams, or senior developers spend all their time firefighting
